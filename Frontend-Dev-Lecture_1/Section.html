    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a passionate software developer, I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. From building responsive front-end interfaces to designing robust back-end systems, I love every aspect of the development process. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me exploring new hiking trails or experimenting with photography.</p>
